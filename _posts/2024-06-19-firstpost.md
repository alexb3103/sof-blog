Hi all, doing the first Thursday report a day early to coincide with the start of the blog as well as the first significant progress.

Firstly thanks very much to Iuliana and all of the SOF community for trusting me with this project. Very excited to continue work as I am finally ready to really lock in on it.

In terms of progress for the week, I've been working locally on a second version of SOF CTL called sof-ctl-backend tuned to my GUI. This version doesn't need many of the features important to the main version, so splitting it off seems like the right call to me. Instead, its designed to be very easy to call from other languages and less so from the command line.

Other than that, I'm waiting on my test hardware to be able to ensure my SOF build worked properly.

Thanks for reading,
Alex
