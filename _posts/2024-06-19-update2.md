Hi all, 

Very happy to say that progress has been very good and I will have my first demo ready by next week (assuming all goes well with my target HW.)

I've fully completed a concrete version of my design for the overall project. Some of the key breakthroughs I had on this front were:

- realizing I can make python bindings for my stripped back version of sof-ctl. In my previous version of the gui, it relied on rapidly sending linux command after linux command to update the various data. By directly calling the control from python this intermediate step will be completely avoided.
- coming up with an abstracted design for the gui and tui that will allow for the control logic to be shared between both.

I've made a lot of progress on stripping back sof-ctl, at this point it just has a few of the necessary methods. With the python bindings, I will be able to pull the codebase back even more. I will get linux command functionality first though, because it will allow for a fallback incase there are unforseen complications with the bindings.

I've also been whiteboarding GUI design, nothing concrete yet but a rough version will be shown in my demo next week.

About the demo:

My plan is to create a video showing the functionality of the demo version. I will share that in next week's update.

That's all for this week, thanks for reading.

- Alex
